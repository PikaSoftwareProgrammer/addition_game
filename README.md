# addition_game
A command-line based python implementation of a game that requires you to add 
numbers together in a style similar to the game 2048. Use 'w', 'a', 's', or 
'd' keys to move numbers one space over in the direction of that key 
(up, left, down, and right respectively). You lose the game if you get a multiple
of 5 on the board. 

The file addition_game_kivy.py is the kivy version of the game, with a very basic
GUI, and touch controls if you manage to compile it for android.
