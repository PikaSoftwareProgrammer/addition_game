# addition_game
A command-line based python implementation of a game that requires you to add 
numbers together in a style similar to the game 2048. Use 'w', 'a', 's', or 
'd' keys to move numbers one space over in the direction of that key 
(up, left, down, and right respectively). You lose the game if you get a multiple
of 5 on the board.
